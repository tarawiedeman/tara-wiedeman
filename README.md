Hi there, my name is Tara and welcome to my GitHub! I've worked in tech for eight years in technical solutions consulting and support; I've helped customers large and small implement their software systems, and debug the toughest of problems. I love mastering new systems, problem solving, and troubleshooting. 

I have a degree in Business and Science so I'm equal parts logical problem-solver and relationship-builder.


👩‍💻 I'm actively seeking further career opportunities as a Software Developer, Technical Consultant, or Technical Support Engineer.  

🤓 I'm passionate about bringing my people and problem solving skills together at work. 

⭐️ I work well independently to complete tasks and enjoy a collaborative team where everyone learns from eachother during sprints.  

📫 I'd love to connect with you on LinkedIn or via email at tara.wiedeman@gmail.com.
